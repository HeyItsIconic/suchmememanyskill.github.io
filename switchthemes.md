## This will make your switch a bit more unstable

Find a theme you like, for example [this one](https://suchmememanyskill.github.io/files/DiscordSwitchTheme.zip).
Drop the **0100000000001000** folder inside the zip in the atmosphere/titles folder
Boot your switch in newest layeredfs mode, that's it!
(note: you do need sd card files that are up to date, otherwise this won't work)

### This only works on version 5.1 as of this moment (6.0 support soon)
