What you need: a microsd card of at least 64gb an unpatched switch lots of spare time Minitool partition wizard free (or any other decent partition manager) atmosphere 0.9.0 or later MakeEmu Instructions: Part 1: The backups Before you start: Make sure you've deleted all your wifi connections on your switch beforehand. It's not a good idea to connect to the internet in emunand. You can add the wifi networks back on sysnand after following this guide. Boot into hekate and make a boot0/1 and raw gpp backup Copy these backups to your pc into a folder If your backup files are split, combine them using the hekate combiner scripts Copy the MakeEmu.exe to the folder containing the nand backup + boot0/1 backup Part 2: The formatting Open Minitool and go to Disk & Partition Management Locate your sd card and partition it as follows: Make 2 partitions The last partition needs to be 29.2GB in size, the first partition you can fill the rest of the space with Both partitions should be fat32 Both partitions should be primary partitions Part 3: The flashing Open an administrator command prompt and navigate to the folder containing your nand backup Make sure your boot0 is called BOOT0 , your boot1 is called BOOT1 and your rawnand is called rawnand.bin Find the drive letter for the 29.2 GB partition on your sd card Type the following into cmd: MakeEmu BOOT0 BOOT1 rawnand.bin <drive letter> Replace <drive letter> with your drive letter, followed by : , so for example K: While this is copying, note down the emummc_sector displayed inside the app. You'll need this later. Part 4: Setup ini Create a folder on the root of the sd card called emummc Create a file in the emummc folder called emummc.ini . Put the following into that ini: [emummc] emummc_enabled = 1 emummc_sector = 0x00000000 Replace 0x00000000 with the offset you got from part 3 in MakeEmu! Now if you boot fusee-primary.bin, you'll instead boot into emunand. You'll see the new black and white atmosphere logo if you did it successfully.

What you need: A micro SD card at least 64gb An unpatched switch A good amount of spare time A micro SD card adapter or a way to plug in a micro SD card to a computer Atmosphere 9.0 or later Instructions: Part 1: The Backup Before you start: Make sure you've deleted all your wifi connections on your switch beforehand. It's not a good idea to connect to the internet in emunand. You can add the wifi networks back on sysnand after following this guide. Boot into hekate and make a boot0/1 and raw gpp backup, you can see the full instructions on how to do this here Copy these backups to your PC. Combine the boot0, boot1, and the rawnand backup into a single file, the command to do this is cat boot0.bin boot1.bin rawnand.bin > emummc.bin If you have you have you nand back up in multiple parts You can run the above cat command but instead of rawnand.bin you would put each and ever nand backup part eg rawnand.bin.00 rawnand.bin.01 rawnand.bin.02 <etc> Part 2: The Formatting Check to make sure gparted is installed (should be with most distros). Open it, and then go to the top right corner and click the correct stoarge device Create 2 partitions, the last one needs to be 29.3GB in size, the first partition can be filled with the rest of the space available. Please make sure both partitions are FAT32 Part 3: The Flashing Open a terminal and type lsblk Locate your SD card in the list of storage devices To flash with dd do the following first: If the path to your emunand contains a space you would add a \\ to indicate a space, ex if=/home/ubuntu/My\\ Folder/emummc.bin alternitivly you may put that folder name in quotes. Then locate the second, 32GB, partition of the sd card, this will your of. this will be shown as of=/dev/sd*xY*/ replace x with the device letter, and Y with the partition number, eg of=/dev/sdb2 or of=dev/mmcblkp2 . lsblk will show you information about your storage devices. Now we do the actual flashing, run the command sudo dd if=/path/to/emummc.bin of=/dev/sd*xY*/ bs=512M status=progress Note This will take quite a while, if you forgot to add the status=progress flag the terminal will not show any output but rest assured, it is flashing Part 4: Get offset Open gparted and go to your sd card. Right click on the partition that you flashed your emunand to and select Information You should see the following: Grab the first sector number and run it through a deciamal to hex converter, one can be found here . You will need the hex value later Part 5: Setup ini Create a folder on the root of the sd card that YOU DID NOT flash your emunand to called emummc Create a file in the emummc folder called emummc.ini . Put the following into that ini: [emummc] emummc_enabled = 1 emummc_sector = 0x(hex offset) The hex offset is the hex value you obtained in part 4. this is at most 8 hex characters Replace \"(hex offset)\" with your obtained hex offset Now if you boot fusee-primary.bin, you'll instead boot into emunand.

Boot into Hekate , Go to tools, Backup eMMC, amd backup both eMMC BOOT0 & BOOT1 and eMMC RAW GPP Step 1: Getting the files What you need: Your own prod.keys file (This needs to be yours specifically (Unless you are trying to just generate the BIS files)! If you don't have them, try to dump them via Lockpick_RCM ) Your switch firmware (Try to dump them via Tegraexplorer if you don't have them) EmmcHaccGen Instructions: Extract the EmmcHaccGen zip somewhere, and place the prod.keys and the fw dump in the same folder Open up a cmd prompt in the same folder, and execute the command EmmcHaccGen.exe --keys (location of the prod.keys file) --fw (location of the firmware folder) (example: EmmcHaccGen --keys prod.keys --fw 9.1.0) ) You should now have a folder called NX-(fw version)_exFAT. If you do, you can continue Step 2: Flashing BOOT0/1 What you need: Etcher TegraRcmGui Manual Memloader If you do not have access to TegraRcmGui, you can download Memloader here, copy the contents of the sample folder to the root of your sd, and inject the memloader.bin payload Instructions: Put your switch in RCM and connect it to your PC Open up TegraRcmGui, go to the tools tab, Select BOOT0 from the dropdown menu, and hit the left USB icon to launch memloader. If after this a popup window pops up that the drive needs to be formatted to use it, Do not format! Click cancel! Open up Etcher, select BOOT0.bin, select Linux UMS disk , and Flash.
