Navigate to Tools > Backup > Backup eMMC BOOT0/1 , and press the power button to select the option. Wait for the process to complete.

If steeldiver is listed in this menu, you have an update for steeldiver installed, delete it. You haven't actually placed the modified save in the steeldiver data folder, or inproperly renamed the save in the steeldiver data folder; the name of the .sav file should be 00000001.sav , and nothing else . (If you have trouble remembering the path where the .sav file is supposed to go, it's in Nintendo 3DS > ID0 > ID1 > title > 00040000 > regionId > data , where regionid for EU is 000d7e00 , US is 000d7d00 , JP is 000d7c00 ) If the game boots with a message saying that corrupted save data has been deleted You may have selected the incorrect region when generating 00000001.sav . All that matters in determining which region you should select is the letter at the end of your system version, not where you physically are. Go back here and download the file again, then copy it into the appropriate folder. (If you have trouble remembering the path where the .sav file is supposed to go, it's in Nintendo 3DS > ID0 > ID1 > title > 00040000 > regionId > data , where regionid for EU is 000d7e00 , US is 000d7d00 , JP is 000d7c00 ) If you selected the correct region and are still getting the message, you did not use your movable.sed ; they are not universal. If the game exits with an error message saying \"an error occured, causing this app to forcibly close, the system will now restart\" Check your payload.bin (so the otherapp payload .bin file that you got from here that you renamed to payload.bin ). Make sure it's in the steelhax folder, and make sure you have file extensions on when you rename it. - - Make sure that the steelhax folder is on the root of the sd card. If the game crashes your system (The screen shows black and says to contact nintendo support) Your 3ds has trouble reading the 00000001.sav file, please check if it's present and named exactly 00000001.sav . (If you have trouble remembering the path where the .sav file is supposed to go, it's in Nintendo 3DS > ID0 > ID1 > title > 00040000 > regionId > data , where regionid for EU is 000d7e00 , US is 000d7d00 , JP is 000d7c00 ) If upon launching the game you get a black screen You probably are using an OLD payload on your NEW 3ds or vice versa; redownload the payload for the correct model It is also possible you already have cfw on your device. To test this, power off your console, hold select, then power on while still holding select. If you get a luma configuration screen, you have cfw. If upon launching the game you get a red screen Check if you have boot.3dsx on the root of the sd card, and that it's named exactly boot.3dsx . If it's there, try copying it to the sd root again. If upon launching the game you get a yellow screen This is just a random crash; reboot and try opening the game again. It can take a few tries. If upon launching the game the system returns to the home menu without an error You probably are using an OLD payload on your NEW 3ds or vice versa; redownload the payload for the correct model If upon launching the game you get a screen saying \"An exception occured\" You already have cfw on your device, so steelhax will not work.

Note: Most emulators will be very unstable with homebrew only. FTPD , A way to wirelessly transfer files to your 3ds An older version of PKSM , a 3ds pokemon savegame editor (put the hax folder in your 3ds folder to install) Things you can't do: Update your system without possibly losing access to homebrew Install FBI Mod games Install cheats to games Use Gameshark codes and such Install your cart based games to your 3ds sd card Virtual console injects Section 3: Miscellaneous addons Q = I have a .3dsx file i'd like to use, how do i use it?
