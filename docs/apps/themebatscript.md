## Theme bat script

Making themes is hard work, that's why i decided to make it a little easier for myself to make themes

### What you need to use it:

- [Meme's automatic theme bat script](https://www.dropbox.com/s/muc6etovn7ilr9h/ProjectCMD.zip?dl=1)
- [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows)
	- Make sure to install to PATH

### How to set up:

Drop the bat script next and the `Overlay` folder next to the `SwitchThemes.exe` app.

### How to use:

Open the bat script, and follow the instructions onscreen. Paths can be relative, like `Images\Theme1\Home.png`. Don't forget to use `\` for the paths, otherwise the app fucks up.
